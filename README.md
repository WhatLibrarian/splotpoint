## Why Do Presentations The Same Way It's Been Done Since the 1980s?

## When You can Do Presentations as Web Native Content!

![](images/splotpoint-demo.jpg "Splotpoint Demo")

This Wordpress Theme powers a site that can be used to deliver presentations on the web, without any residue of commercial slideware. Your presentations not only look good, they also become the reference resource (e.g. additional links and info)



## With Thanks

SPLOTs have no venture capital, no IPOs, no real funding at all. But they have been helped along by a few groups worth recognizing with an icon and a link.

SPLOTPoint was inspired by web-based presentations created during [Thompson Rivers University Open Learning Fellowship](http://cogdog.trubox.ca/) and the first version was developed independently a few years later. Further development was supported in part by a [Reclaim Hosting Fellowship](http://reclaimhosting.com), an [OpenETC grant](https://opened.ca), and ongoing support by [Patreon patrons](https://patreon.com/cogdog).

I developed a series of custom sites like this initially [while on a fellowship](http://cogdog.trubox.ca) at [Thompson Rivers University](http://tru.ca/) and has now been generalized as part of the collection of [SPLOT tools](http://splot.ca/).

And if you make your own Splotpoint, please please pretty please fork this repo to edit this Readme with a link to your spiffy example (otherwise [we may just Google you and add it anyhow](https://www.google.ca/search?q="SPLOTpoint+Theme")). Or leave a message via the issues link below.

If you have problems, feature suggestions, small bags of gold coin for me, please [contact me via the issues area](https://github.com/cogdog/splotpoint/issues) on this repo.

## Requirements

I will make a grand assumptive leap in that you have a self hosted Wordpress site and can install themes. Splotpoint is a child theme based on [Intergalactic Theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/intergalactic).


## Installing SPLOTpoint

Using this theme requires a self-hosted--or institutionally hosted (lucky you)-- Wordpress site (the kind that you download from [wordpress.org](http://www.wordpress.org). You cannot use this theme on the free "wordpress.com" site unless you have a business plan. Maybe check out [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/) if you choose to set up your own hosting space. 

SPLOTpoint is a child theme based on [Intergalactic theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/intergalactic). Install this theme first from within the Wordpress Dashboard under **Appearance** -- **Themes** searching on `Intergalactic`.

### Installing SPLOTpoint from Scratch

You can download a ZIP file of this theme via the green **Code*" button above (use the Download Zip option). 

The zip can be uploaded directly to your site via **Themes** in the Wordpress dashboard, then **Add Theme** and finally **Upload Theme**. If you run into size upload limits or just prefer going old school like me, unzip the package and ftp the entire folder into your `wp-content/themes` directory.

### Updating SPLOTpoint (manually)

As of WordPress version 5.5, themes uploaded as .ZIP files can now be updated the same way you installed it. Just download the newest version, and update it by going to **Themes** in the Wordpress dashboard, then **Add Theme** and finally **Upload Theme**. You will be asked to confirm updating the theme with the newer version.  

### Installing SPLOTpoint in One Click with WP Pusher (get automatic updates!)

To have your site stay up to date automatically, I recommend trying the [WP Pusher plugin](https://wppusher.com/) which makes it easier to install themes and plugins that are published in GitHub. It takes a few steps to set up, but it's the most direct way to get updates to the theme.

To use WP-Pusher you will need to have or create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (free). Log in. 

Next [download WP Pusher plugin](https://wppusher.com/download) as a ZIP file. From the plugins area of your Wordpress dashboard, click the **Upload Plugin** button, select that zip file to upload, and activate the plugin.

Then click the **WP Pusher** option in your Wordpress Dashboard, and then click the **GitHub** tab. Next click the **Obtain a GitHub Token** button to get an authentication token. Copy the one that is generated, paste into the field for it, and finally, click **Save GitHub** Token.

Now you are ready to install SPLOTpoint! 

![](images/wp-pusher.jpg "WP Pusher Settings")

Look under **WP Pusher** for **Install Theme**. In the form that appears, under **Theme Repository**, enter `cogdog/splotpoint`. Also check the option for **Push-to-Deploy** (this will automatically update your site when the theme is updated) finally, click **Install Theme**.

Woah Neo?

Not only does this install the theme without any messy download/uploads, each time I update the theme on GitHub, your site will be automatically updated to the newest version.  

## Loosely Referred to as Documentation


![](images/splotpoint-new.jpg "New SPLOTpoint")

### Making Slides

In this theme Wordpress `Posts` are renamed `Slides` -- create maybe 2,3 new ones. In the Post Editor, add your title, a featured image, and use the `Slide Attribute` box on the right to designate the order your slide sits in the deck (this can be edited easily later).

![](images/slide-attributes.jpg "Slide Attributes")

For the body text of all slides, all headings will be center aligned by default.

In the Slides (Posts) Dasbboard listing, your slides  are listed in order of the Slide Attribute.
 
![](images/splotpoint-slides.jpg "Slide Listings")

You can quickly modify titles and slide order via the 'Quick Edit" link that appears when you hover over a slide title.

### Customizing the Slide deck

Once you have 3 or more slides, you can "pretty" things in the Wordpress Customizer (via the `Customize` link in the Admin toolbar while viewing the site or under `Appearance - Customize` in the Wordpress Dashboard.

When the Customizer launches, click the `SPLOTPoint Prettify` section

![](images/customizer1.jpg "Customizer First View")

For the Site title, you can add an image to use as a backdrop, plus change the colors of the show title and the subtitle 

![](images/title-stuff.jpg "Prettifying the title")

You should see changes as you choose colors (or upload a new image).

Now in the right side click the title of the top "Slide" (aka Post) to open it, and scroll to the bottom.

Here you can edit the color of the buttons and edit the text displayed in the footer.

![](images/buttons.jpg "Prettifying the buttons")

Save your changes. Jump for joy.

### Create a Landing Page

The default of your site is a normal blog post listing. Yecch.

Create a new Wordpress Page that will soon become your landing page. The title will show up in the black bar below the main image you set above. The coptent can be a description of your presentation, your name, etc whatever you want to show up front. 

Use the `[startbutton]` shortcode followed by the `[slidelist]` one to generate a button that launches the slideshow plus a dynamically generated list of links to all slides:

![](images/shortcodes-start.jpg "Shortcodes for front page")

Publish the page.

Now launch the Customizer while this page is in view. Open the section for `Static Front Page` and change the option for Front page displays to be `a static page`. From the Front page menu, select the name of the page you just created.

Click `Save & Publish` and marvel at your slick Splotpoint. 

## All Shortcodes

`[slidelist]` generates an ordered list of all slides, can be used in front landing page and/or widgets

`[slidelist count=5]` generates an ordered list of the first 5 slides.

`[slidelist count=5 offset=5]` generates an ordered list of the 5 slides starting at slide 6.

`[startbutton]` inserts a button (styled like slide navigation buttons) to launch the first slide

`[startbutton title="go"]` customizes the text on the button

`[startbutton start="4"]` start the slideshow at slide number 4
